1. **User Input**:  
   Users fill out an interactive form on the web app with invoice details like client name, item details, and more.

2. **Dynamic Calculations**:  
   JavaScript ensures that the total amount (quantity √ó price) updates instantly on the frontend.

3. **Template Selection**:

   Store generated invoices in a database for future reference.
